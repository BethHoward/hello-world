# hello-world
first GitHub repo

These are my first steps toward learning to code. I want to learn to code because I'm fascinated by the way coding makes things happen - kind of the way language makes things happen. I feel excited, like I'm getting ready to learn a new language; I love learning new languages because it's a way to connect to new people and places and to make new things happen for myself.
